# Barbershop-Backend

This is the backend of the Barbershop application, developed with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Overview
The Barbershop app allows users to book appointments for various services. This backend handles the data storage, manages appointments, and serves the necessary API for the frontend.

## Features
- RESTful API for managing appointments
- Integration with MongoDB for data storage
- Simple and lightweight Express server
- CORS support for communication with the frontend
- Uses dotenv for environment variable management

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used to build the backend.
- **Express**: Web framework used to build the server and handle HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing appointment data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Setup
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codingwidad/Barbershop-backend.git


## Deployment
The Barbershop backend is deployed on Heroku. You can access it here: https://barbershop-frontend-c9bc85b848fb.herokuapp.com/

## Future Improvements
This project was completed in 1 hour. If I had more time, I would:

Implement user authentication and authorization.
Add input validation for the appointment data.
Set up logging and error handling.
Deploy the application with proper environment configuration (e.g., staging, production).
